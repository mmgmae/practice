      let age = 100;
      let age2 = age;
      console.log(age, age2);
      age = 200;
      console.log(age, age2);

      // prints 200 100 -- because the value of age goes into the variable at the same time. changing the original later will not update the second one
      let name = "Mae";
      let name2 = name;
      console.log(name, name2);
      name = "Maebe";
      console.log(name, name2);
      // Maebe Mae

      // Let's say we have an array
      const players = ["Wes", "Sarah", "Ryan", "Poppy"];

      // and we want to make a copy of it.
      const team = players;
      console.log(players, team);

      // You might think we can just do something like this:
      team[3] = "Lux";

      // however what happens when we update that array?
      console.log(players, team);
      // ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Lux'] (4)Â ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Lux'] -- updates both team and players, the original array

      // now here is the problem!

      // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

      // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

      // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!

      // one way
      const team2 = players.slice(); //will return entire array

      // or create a new array and concat the old one in
      const team3 = [].concat(players);

      // or use the new ES6 Spread
      const team4 = [...players];
      team4[3] = "updated!";

      console.log(players, team4);
      // (4)Â ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Lux'] (4)Â ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'updated!']

      // Another method...
      const team5 = Array.from(players);

      // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

      // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

      // with Objects
      const person = {
        name: "Wes Bos",
        age: 80,
      };

      // and think we make a copy:
      const captain = person;
      captain.number = 99;

      console.log(person, captain);
      //{name: 'Wes Bos', age: 80, number: 99} {name: 'Wes Bos', age: 80, number: 99} -- the original was updated as well

      // how do we take a copy instead?
      const cap2 = Object.assign({}, person, { number: 100 });
      console.log(person, cap2);

      // {name: 'Wes Bos', age: 80, number: 99} {name: 'Wes Bos', age: 80, number: 100} -- only changed the copy

      // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread

      // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.

      const dog = {
        name: "Missy",
        age: 11,
        status: {
          looks: "cute",
          is: "adorable",
          color: "white",
          texture: "fluffy",
        },
      };

      console.log(dog);

      const dog2 = Object.assign({}, dog);
      console.log(dog2);

      dog2.name = "Missy Pup";

      console.log(dog, dog2);
      //{name: 'Missy', age: 11, status: {â€¦}} {name: 'Missy Pup', age: 11, status: {â€¦}} -- a successful copy, updating the new one doesnt change the original

      // HOWEVER...
      dog2.status.texture = "curly";

      console.log(dog, dog2);
      // BOTH status: texture updated to curly.... BECAUSE Object.assign only goes one level deep.
      // Solution: use a CLONE DEEP function -- but do you actually need to do this or can you do something better?
