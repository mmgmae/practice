DAY TWO

# BOOLEANS
    - store simple TRUE or FALSE values
    - exist in swift as false and true, no capitalizations

    # how to make a boolean 

        >   let goodDog = true
        >   var gameOver = false

    # boolean operator = !
        - flips true to false and false to true 

        >   var isAuthenticated = false
        >   isAuthenticated = !isAuthenticated

        >   print(isAuthenticated)
        >   // true

    # boolean functionality 

        - .toggle()
            - will also flip from true to false, like !
            - useful for dealing with complex numbers

            >   var gameOver = false
            >   gameOver.toggle()

            >   print(gameOver)
            >   // true

# HOW TO JOIN STRINGS TOGETHER

    # join using +

        >   let firstPart = "Hello, "
        >   let secondPart = "world"

        >   let greeting = firstPart + secondPart + "!"
        >   // "Hello, world!"

        - the operator + is "overloaded" can be used in concatonation as well as mathematical operations, depending on the context

        - this technique is good for small things, but should not be overused because it is multiple operations for swift so it's wasteful


    # string interpolation \(var)
        - build strings from other strings and other types of data
        - not unlike using "a string with \"backslashes\" so you can use more quotes inside of quotes"
        
        >   let name = "Jim"
        >   let age = 26
        >   let message = "Hello, my name is \(name) and I'm \(age) years old."
        >   print(message)
        >   // "Hello, my name is Jim and I'm 26 years old."

        - math is also ok!

        >   print("5 x 5 is \(5 * 5)")
        >   // "5 x 5 is 25"

        NOTE: with string interpolation integers can be added to string seamlessly, don't have to be converted into strings

        # how to add numbers with the + operator String(var)
            - possible, but still easier to read with string interpolation instead

            >   let number = 11
            >   let missionMessage = "Apollo " + String(number) + " landed on the moon."

# SIMPLE DATA SUMMARY

    - let for constants, preferred
    - var for variables
    - strings can be short or long, multiline use """, both on own line
        - use count of uppercased on strings
    - Int is integer, Double is for decimals
        - doubles are bad for storing money, because they arent accurate
    - boolen is Bool, can use ! or toggle to switch true and false
    - string iterpolation is done with \(x)
