CONDITIONALS (the last section)

TRUTHY vs FALSE-Y & CONDITIONALS
    - False, None, 0.0, 0, empty strings, empty data structures are all FALSE-Y
    - Everything else is TRUTHY

EXAMPLE
    >   color = input('enter a color: ')
    >   if color: 
    >       print(f"{color} is my favorite color too!")

- python will evaluate color as a boolean
- if it's anything other than an empty string, the block will run; if it evaluates an empty string it turns false-y and does not run the code block

EXAMPLE
    >   num_lives = 0
    >   if num_lives:
    >       print('STILL PLAYING THE GAME!')
    >   else:
    >       print("GAME OVER, OUT OF LIVES")

- since zero is false-y, code will only evaluate to True if there are still lives left


-> This construction is epecially popular with data structures

LOGICAL OPERATOR PRECEDENCE
    - python docs has a table of precedence of every operator in python

    (first) NOT -> AND -> OR (last)
    
    NOTE: parentheses can be used to change order
