MODULES
    - a module is a python file that contains code that can be re-used in other files
    - modules allow us to break up complex programs into smaller, more manageable pieces across multiple files

    # 3 types of modules...

        # BUILT-IN 
            - The Python Standard Library -- has all of the stuff that comes with python, including modules
            - Python comes with tons of built-in modules that we can use if we IMPORT them
            - each module consists of methods and functionality bundled together

            IMPORT...
                to use a module, we must import it first using the IMPORT KEYWORD

                    >   import random
                    >   random.randint(1,6)  // 3

            NOTE: it is conventional to put all of your imports at the top of your code file

            IMPORT AS ...
                use the as keyword to import a module and give it a custom name in your script

                    >   import random as rand
                    >   rand.randint(1,6)

            FROM ... IMPORT ...
                use the from <module> import <method, constant, etc> syntax to import specific pieces of a module
                - can chain on extras with commas, if you want to include more than one

                    >   from random import randint
                    >   randint(1,6)

            IMPORT * ....
                we can import all pieces of a module individually using import * 
                - however, this usually is not the best approach to importing!
                - bad, because you're polluting your name space with things you probably don't even know about

                    >   from random import *
                    >   randint(1,6) 

        # CUSTOM 
            must be located into the same folder and simply use import

                > import utils

            or...

                > from utils import brand_colors
                > print(brand_colors)

            # PIP
                - PIP - Pip Installs Packages
                - pip is the python package installer that we  can use to install hundreds of thousands of packages for use in our projects
                - pip comes bundled with python!

            Ensure you can run pip from the command line...

                >   python3 -m pip --version

            Where to find external packages? ...
                - PYPI.ORG  (python package index)
                - find, install, and publish python packages

                PIP INSTALL...
                    to install a package, use python3 -m pip install followed by the exact name of the package

                    >   python3 -m pip install <package>
