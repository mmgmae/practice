Unit 12 -- Writing More Complex Logic
-------------------------------------

Logical Operators -> operators that work with boolean expressions
    and 
    or
    not

LOGICAL AND
    The and operator will evaluate to True only if both the left and right sides evaluate to True

    >   'a' == 'a' and 1 < 5
    >   True

    NOTE: usually && in most programming languages, but python uses the word AND

LOGICAL OR
    The or operator will evaluate to True if one or both the left or right sides evaluate to True
    Only one side has to be true, if both are true that's fine too

    >   'a' == 'b' or 1 < 5
    >   True

LOGICAL NOT
    The not operator changes True to False and False to True. It negates expressions. Not is used on a single operand / expression

    >   1 < 5
    >   True

    >   not 1 < 5
    >   False

    NOTE: not expects something to come after it that it will negate. Adding not to the end of an expression is invalid syntax
    NOTE: do not confuse not with != 
        >   1 != 4 
        >   True

        >   not 5 <= 19
        >   False

    NOT is often used to rephrase logic so that it's easier to understand / more similar to human contexts
