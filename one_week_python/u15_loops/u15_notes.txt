LOOPS

BREAK & CONTINUE --> keywords to use inside of a LOOP
    -> can be useful, but not necessarily used all the time

BREAK
    use the break keyword to prematurely exit a loop. Usually this is done inside of a conditional
    
    >   for char in "pickleface":
    >       if char == "f":
    >           break
    >       print(char)
    >   // p i c k l e

    once the if becomes true, break runs and the rest of the loop is skipped 

CONTINUE
    the continue keyword ends the current iteration of the loop, but does not break out of the loop -- the loop continues

    >   for char in "FATCAT":
    >       if char == "A":
    >           continue
    >       print(char)
    >   // F T C T


NESTED LOOPS
    a loop with another (or multiple) loops nested inside

    example with outer and inner loops ...

    >   for outer in range (1,5):
    >       print(outer)
    >       for inner in range (1,5):
    >           print(inner)
    >   //  1 1234  2 1234  3 1234  4 1234   outer  inner

    NOTE: the inner loop runs completely (full cycle) every time the outer loop runs once through its cycle
