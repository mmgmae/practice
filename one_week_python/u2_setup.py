# 2 ways to run python: interactive / from a file

# interactive (in the terminal prompt)  --> in terminal: python3
    # exit interactive python with exit() or control + d
    # ipython - slightly easier to use interactive python --> in terminal: ipython
        # control + L -- clear screen
# run from a file - execute the script --> in terminal: python game.py 

#repl.it --> creates coding environments directly in the browser
